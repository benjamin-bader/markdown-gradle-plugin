Markdown Gradle Plugin
----------------------

Simple, opinionated, documentation generator

Simple
------

Why simple?  All you have to do is write Markdown-formatted documentation, apply this plugin, and bask in the glory of rendered HTML.

Opinionated
-----------

Why opinionated?  We think that the best balance of features and simplicity is a set of Markdown files, referencing each other using a simple link syntax, and transliterating those into HTML.  No Javadoc, no Javascript, just documentation.
